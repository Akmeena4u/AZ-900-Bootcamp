## Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, artificial intelligence, and more. Azure allows businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through a global network of data centers.

#### What is cloud computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

 if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

#### Describe the shared responsibility model

- **Traditional Corporate Datacenter Responsibilities:**
  - Company: Physical space maintenance, security, server maintenance/replacement.
  - IT Department: Infrastructure and software maintenance, system patching, version control.

- **Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Computing:**
  - **Cloud Provider Responsibilities:**
    - Physical security, power, cooling, network connectivity.
  - **Consumer Responsibilities:**
    - Data and information stored in the cloud.
    - Access security (granting access only to authorized individuals).
    
- **Varied Responsibilities Depending on Cloud Service Type:**
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
    - Consumer-centric responsibilities (more control).
    - Cloud provider: Basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
    - Cloud provider-centric responsibilities (less consumer control).
    - Consumer focuses on data and access security.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
    - Balanced responsibilities between cloud provider and consumer.
    - Shared responsibility in maintaining infrastructure and applications.

- **Universal Responsibilities:**
  - Data and information stored in the cloud.
  - Devices allowed to connect to the cloud.
  - Accounts and identities within the organization.

- **Cloud Provider Always Responsible For:**
  - Physical datacenter.
  - Physical network.
  - Physical hosts.

#### Define cloud models

- **Cloud Models Definition:**
  - **Private Cloud:**
    - Evolution from a corporate datacenter.
    - IT services delivered over the internet for a single entity.
    - Greater control for the company and its IT department.
    - May be hosted on-site or in a dedicated offsite datacenter.

  - **Public Cloud:**
    - Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider.
    - Accessible to anyone purchasing cloud services.
    - General public availability distinguishes it from private clouds.

  - **Hybrid Cloud:**
    - Utilizes both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.
    - Enables private cloud scaling using public cloud resources.
    - Offers flexibility in choosing services for public and private clouds.
    -

- **Multi-Cloud Scenario:**
  - Involves using multiple public cloud providers.
  - Users may utilize different features from different providers.
  - Offers flexibility and resource management across various environments.

- **Azure Arc:**
  - Set of technologies for managing diverse cloud environments.
  - Manages public, private, hybrid, or multi-cloud configurations.
  - Supports environments solely on Azure, private datacenters, hybrid, or multiple cloud providers.

- **Azure VMware Solution:**
  - Facilitates migration from VMware in a private cloud to a public or hybrid cloud.
  - Allows running VMware workloads in Azure seamlessly.
  - Offers integration and scalability.

#### Describe the consumption-based model

**Consumption-Based Model Summary:**

- **Expense Types:**
  - **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):**
    - Up-front expenditure for tangible resources.
    - Examples: Building, datacenter, company vehicle.

  - **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):**
    - Spending money on services or products over time.
    - Examples: Renting a venue, leasing a vehicle, cloud services.

- **Cloud Computing and OpEx:**
  - Operates on a consumption-based model.
  - Payment for IT resources used, not for physical infrastructure.
  - No upfront costs, only pay for what is consumed.

- **Benefits of Consumption-Based Model:**
  - No upfront expenses.
  - Avoidance of managing costly, underutilized infrastructure.
  - Flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand.
  - Stop paying for resources when they are no longer needed.

- **Traditional Datacenter Challenges:**
  - Estimating future resource needs is challenging.
  - Overestimation leads to wasted expenditure.
  - Underestimation results in capacity issues and decreased performance.
  - Fixing under-provisioned datacenters is time-consuming.

- **Cloud-Based Model Advantages:**
  - Dynamic resource allocation.
  - Add or remove virtual machines based on demand.
  - Pay only for resources used, avoiding extra capacity costs.

- **Cloud Computing Pricing Model:**
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  - Pay only for the cloud services utilized.
  - Facilitates efficient cost planning, infrastructure management, and scalability.

- **Cloud Computing Essence:**
  - Renting compute power and storage from a provider's datacenter.
  - Treat cloud resources like your own but return them when done.
  - Billed only for actual usage, not for reserved capacity.

- **Impact on Business:**
  - Enables efficient cost planning.
  - Enhances infrastructure efficiency.
  - Facilitates rapid scalability as business needs change.

# Economies of Scale

## **Principle Overview**
The principle of economies of scale asserts that as companies expand, they become more efficient in managing shared operations across various functions, such as:

### Shared Operations
- HR and hiring
- Taxes
- Accounting
- Internal operations
- Marketing

### Cost Reduction Opportunities
- Big purchases via contracts for better discounts

## **Impact on Services**
As companies achieve economies of scale, they can save and earn more. This, in turn, allows for a reduction in the cost of their services to customers, often referred to as the 'price per unit'.

## **Limitations**
While it's not feasible to reduce costs to zero, as underlying infrastructure expenses persist, larger scales enable companies to pass more benefits to customers.

## **Microsoft's Example**
In the current scale, Microsoft can offer multiple services for free, leveraging the minimal fraction of cost associated with providing those services.
